> **WARNING**: This repository is deprecated. Please use the [Crazyswarm](http://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io) instead, even when only operating a single Crazyflie. If you are missing features in the Crazyswarm, feel free to [open an open issue](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm/issues).

crazyflie_ros
=============

ROS stack for Bitcraze Crazyflie (http://www.bitcraze.se/), with the following features:

* Support for Crazyflie 1.0 and Crazyflie 2.0 (using stock firmware)
* Publishes on-board sensors in ROS standard message formats
* Supports ROS parameters to reconfigure crazyflie parameters
* Support for using multiple Crazyflies with a single Crazyradio
* Includes external controller for waypoint navigation (if motion capture system is available)
* No dependency to the Bitcraze SDK (Driver and Controller written in C++)

A tutorial (for a slightly older version) is available in W. HÃ¶nig and N. Ayanian. "Flying Multiple UAVs Using ROS", Chapter in Robot Operating System (ROS): The Complete Reference (Volume 2), Springer, 2017. (see http://act.usc.edu/publications.html for a free pre-print).
